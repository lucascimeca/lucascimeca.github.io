# [](#Intro) Introduction

I am a PhD student in Engineering at the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I conduct my research at the university's <a href="http://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/birl/" target="_blank">Biologically Inspired Robotics Laboratory</a> (BIRL), supervised by Dr. Fumiya Iida. 

My background in the field of IT goes back to before university when, studying in the Computer Science sector of a technical secondary school, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the basics of programming, design and analysis which brought me to the successful completion of a robotics project on my final year.

Throughout my academic career I have taken part to several research projects and competitions which allowed me to build a strong background in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Robotics.

I graduated from the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a> with a First Class degree in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, obtaining the Class award and Howe Prize for the best performance in Artificial Intelligence.

# [](#Research) Research

My interests lie mainly in Machine Learning and Robotics research, particularly I'm interested in algorithms for motion control, the use of vision and the application of Machine Learning to solve robotics problems (Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning).

### [](#RoboAnt) RoboAnt _(University of Edinburgh, 2016-2017)_  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lucascimeca/antbot-a-biologically-inspired-approach-to-path-integration/raw/90d120d07c7fc6221d4ef454e8d6abab17988a72/Luca_Scimeca_AntBot.pdf" class="fa fa-download" style="font-size: 20px"></a>

> As part of my thesis at the university of Edinburgh I have worked with Dr. Barbara Webb on AntBot a mobile-phone powered autonomous robot implementing a novel neural model for insect navigation. 

### [](#DNN) Image Classification With Deep Neural Networks _(University of Edinburgh, 2016-2017)_ <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lucascimeca/deep-neural-networks-cifar-10-cifar-100-datasets?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BGUJg49LJSNqF2TBvYYXHiQ%3D%3D" class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size: 20px" target="_blank"></a>

> I created Tensor Flow Deep Neural Networks to classify colored images in the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. I run experiments with particular focus on Multitask Learning and crated and adopted new learning rules for Multitask Learning on CNNs.

### [](#DNN-mnist) Hand Digit classification with Deep Neural Networks _(University of Edinburgh, 2016)_ <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lucascimeca/deep-neural-networks-mnist-dataset?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BGUJg49LJSNqF2TBvYYXHiQ%3D%3D" class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size: 20px" target="_blank"></a>

> I experimented with Adaptive Learning Rules, Batch Normalization, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other standard NN approaches. I performed experiments on the MNIST dataset, achieving near state of the art performance and increasing CNN forward and backward propagation speed of common algorithms of 2x (Python, no GPU).
