# [](#Intro) Introduction
<hr style="width: 180px">

I am a PhD student in Engineering at the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I conduct my research at the university's <a href="http://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/birl/" target="_blank">Biologically Inspired Robotics Laboratory</a> (BIRL), supervised by Dr. Fumiya Iida. 

My background in the field of IT goes back to before university when, studying in the Computer Science sector of a technical secondary school, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the basics of programming, design and analysis which brought me to the successful completion of a robotics project on my final year.

Throughout my academic career I have taken part to several research projects and competitions which allowed me to build a strong background in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Robotics.

I graduated summa cum laude from the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a> with a First Class degree in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, obtaining the Class award and Howe Prize for the best performance in Artificial Intelligence.

I have won over 13 awards among which 9 paid scholarships for academic performance.

My interests lie mainly in Machine Learning and Robotics research, particularly I'm interested in algorithms for motion control, the use of vision and the application of Machine Learning to solve robotics problems (Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning).

> I experimented with Adaptive Learning Rules, Batch Normalization, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other standard NN approaches. I performed experiments on the MNIST dataset, achieving near state of the art performance and increasing CNN forward and backward propagation speed of common algorithms of 2x (Python, no GPU).

### Interests

In my spare time I like to practice outdoors activities, usually entailing scuba diving or hiking/climbing. I also love traveling and backpacking which I do anytime I can. 

I am passionate about martial arts. I have practiced Judo since I was 9, participating to competitions at a national and international level. I received my black belt about 7 years after that.

Ultimately I like playing chess. I joined different chess clubs since the age of 12, but I mostly do it sporadically as a hobby now.
