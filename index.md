# [](#Intro) Introduction
<hr style="width: 180px">

I am a PhD student in Engineering at the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Cambridge</a>. I conduct my research at the university's <a href="http://divf.eng.cam.ac.uk/birl/" target="_blank">Biologically Inspired Robotics Laboratory</a> (BIRL), supervised by Dr. Fumiya Iida. 

My background in the field of IT goes back to before university when, studying in the Computer Science sector of a technical secondary school, I had the opportunity to familiarize myself with the basics of programming, design and analysis which brought me to the successful completion of a robotics project on my final year.

I graduated summa cum laude from the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a> with a First Class degree in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, obtaining the Class award and Howe Prize for the best performance in Artificial Intelligence. Throughout my academic career I have taken part to several research projects and competitions which allowed me to build a strong background in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Robotics.

I have won over 13 awards among which 9 paid scholarships for academic performance.

# [](#Research) Research
<hr style="width: 130px">

My interests lie mainly in Machine Learning and Robotics, particularly I am interested in algorithms for motion control, the use of vision and the application of Machine Learning to solve robotics problems (Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning). I am currently carrying out research on the use of tactile perception and the employment of morphology, and motor-coordinated behaviour to aid in manipulation tasks.
